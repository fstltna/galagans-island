summary:   Galagan's Island is our Arcade style Space Shooter
description: |
  Galagan's Island is our Arcade style Space Shooter with loving homage to classic arcade style and difficulty. Featuring 25 levels of handcrafted whimsical charm. So pretty you almost don't want to destroy them. LOL! Galagan's Island utilizes dynamic scaling of ship abilities. As you progress through the game your ability to perform improves as well. Is it a feature to have enemy AI that includes moving/changing formations &amp; attack? Or is that actually mandatory? I mean look at Pac-Man guys...I'm just trying to do my job here. Unique flight controls. Cause I said so darnit! PIXELS!!! Nope, not because we are broke, or Indie, or can't draw assets.....WTH!!! BECAUSE PIXELS ARE KING BABY!
